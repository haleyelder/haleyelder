## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Senior Solutions Engineer and web developer in Portland, Oregon! I've been self teaching myself code since about 2014, primarily following the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. So far, I've focused on front end to a taste of fullstack JavaScript projects and will be expanding to some Python in the future.

I'm also:\
